#Titanic Survival Prediction
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using data analysis and machine learning techniques.

#📂 Dataset

The dataset used is the Titanic Dataset, which contains data for 891 passengers with the following features:

PassengerId

Survived

Pclass

Name

Sex

Age

SibSp

Parch

Ticket

Fare

Cabin

Embarked

#📊 Libraries Used
pandas, numpy: Data manipulation and analysis

matplotlib, seaborn: Data visualization

sklearn: Preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation


🚀 Steps Covered
Data Loading & Cleaning:

Handled missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized survival rates across different features like sex, class, age, etc.

Feature Engineering:

Encoded categorical variables and scaled numeric data.

Model Building (if done in your notebook):

Applied ML models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.

Evaluation:

Evaluated model accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.

#📁 How to Run
Clone the repo:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-survival-prediction.git
Navigate into the project folder.

Open Titanic.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.

Run all cells sequentially.

#📌 Notes
The project is a beginner-friendly application of data science and ML on a popular dataset.

Useful for practicing preprocessing, EDA, and basic modeling techniques.
